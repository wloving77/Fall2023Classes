# Quiz 6:
```{r}

library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)

shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    sliderInput("span1", label = "Span adjustment Iris:",
                min = 1, max = 6.9, value = 1, step = 0.6),
    plotOutput("irisplot"), 
    sliderInput("span2", label = "Span adjustment Mtcars:",
                min = .2, max = .9, value = .3, step = 0.1),
    plotOutput("mtcarsplot")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$irisplot <- renderPlot({
      ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color=Species)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, span = input$span1, color="blue") +
        theme_bw()
    })
    output$mtcarsplot <- renderPlot ({
        ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
        geom_point() +
        geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE, span = input$span2, color="blue") +

# Bonus: 

## Layout 1: 
- You could use a fluid-page layout to display a title with sidebar panels below it for readability and ease of use as well as to allow dynamic page resizing: 

## Layout 2:
- You could use a multi-page layout to separate your app into multiple different pages to allow for separation of concerns and better organization.

## Layout 3: 
- You could use a Navbar layout as well to creata a consistent navbar across your pages for a consistent and usable design.
