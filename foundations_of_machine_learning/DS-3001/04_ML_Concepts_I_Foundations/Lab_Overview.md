# Lab Overview 

Key Points to Cover
* Developing DS questions
* Developing metrics associated with question
* Target variables 
* Type of Model 
* Data Brainstorming
* Incorporating a Data Science perspective to problem solving

Read through the case study and then discuss the problem as a group then address these questions below:

* What problems are facing the organization? 
* Given the data overview, what problem(s) could potential be solved? 
* How would you know the solution was working? 
* What is your target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are you developing? 

Work through the following Data to Concept and Learning Difficulty questions presented from this weeks lecture:
  * How difficult is the data to gather?
  * How well does the data match your problem?
  * Has the data been used in the past with success?
  * Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
  * What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept? 

Take 20 to 30 minutes to gather your answers then we will discuss. I do want you to submit a written summary of the results so it might be a good idea to assign a note taker.  

Case Study Overview: 

A non-profit is working to develop a recommender engine for school districts
looking to invest in Mathematics software for educational purposes. It is
estimated that every year billions of dollars across US K-12 education is spent and
often wasted by purchasing software that doesn't match the needs and skills of 
individual schools inside districts. 

The non-profit has begun to gather data from several school districts in the mid-west
and wants to start building a "MVP" of the recommender system in order be able to 
garner support for further data gathering efforts. The data includes survey responses
on a likert (1-5) scale cover 60ish questions related to the characteristics of the schools, technology proficiency and features covering past successes or failures as it relates to the implementation of mathematical software. The data has 1500 responses across 30 districts with no one district have more that 100 responses. 

The goal is to be able to go to new schools/districts have them complete the survey and 
then provide recommendations as to which mathematical software would work and those that might not be good choices.
