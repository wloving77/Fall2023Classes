## Overview of Functions (Advanced R)

- Functions are at the core of R language, it's really a function based language

>"R, at its heart, is a "functional" language. This means that it has certain technical properties, but more importantly that it lends itself to a style of problem solving centred on functions." Hadley Wickham 

## What is a functional based language?

- Recently functions have grown in popularity because they can produce efficient and simple solutions to lots of problems. Many of the problems with performance have been solved.  

- Functional programming compliments object oriented programming

## What makes a programming approach "functional"?

- Functions can behave like any other data structure

  - Assign them to variables, store to lists, pass them as aurguments to other functions, create them inside functions and even produce a function as a result of a funcion

- Functions need to be "pure" meaning that if you call it again with the same inputs you get the same results. sys.time() not a "pure" function

- The execution of the function shouldn't change global variables, have no side effects. 

## Functions

- Function don't have to be "pure" but it can help to ensure your code is doing what you intend it to do. 

- Functional programming helps to break a problem down into it's pieces. When working to solve a problem it helps to divide the code into individually operating functions that solve parts of the problem. 

## Types of Functions

![Function Types](fp.png)

## Let's Build a Function

- Basically recipes composed of series of R statements

```{r, eval=FALSE}
name <- funtion(variables){
  #In here goes the series of R statements
}
```

## Example, talk out the steps

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x){
  Sum <- sum(x)#Here we are using a function 
  #inside a function!
  N <- length(x)
  return(Sum/N)#return is optional but helps with 
  #clarity on some level. 
}

```
>Create a little list and pass it to the function and see if it works. Also call the Sum and N variables...does this work?

## Functional - Will show later, Function Factory (Advanced R)

```{r}
power1 <- function(exp) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exp
  }
}

#Assigning the exponentials
square <- power1(2)
cube <- power1(3)

```

## Run the Created Functions
```{r}
square(3)
cube(3)
```



## Quick Exercise

>Create a function that computes the range of a variable and then for no good reason adds 100 and divides by 10. Write out the steps you would need first in Pseudocode, then develop the function. 


## `dplyr` verbs in the tidyverse

The `dplyr` package gives us a few verbs for data manipulation

```{r 01-lecture1-46, echo = F, results='asis'}
dat <- tribble(
  ~Function, ~Purpose,
  'select', "Select columns based on name or position",
  'mutate', 'Create or change a column',
  'filter', 'Extract rows based on some criteria',
  'arrange', 'Re-order rows based on values of variable(s)',
  'group_by', 'Split a dataset by unique values of a variable',
  'summarize', 'Create summary statistics based on columns')
knitr::kable(dat, format='markdown')
```

## `select`

You can select columns by name or position, of course. 

You can also select columns based on some criteria, 
which are encapsulated in functions.

- starts_with("___"), ends_with("___"), contains("____")
- one_of("____","_____","______")

There are others; see `help(starts_with)`.


## Example

Load the `weather.csv`. This contains daily temperature data in 2010 for some location.

```{r 01-lecture1-47, echo = F}
weather <- rio::import('data/weather.csv')
getwd()
```

```{r 01-lecture1-48}
head(weather, 2)
```

## How would you just select the columns with the daily data?

```{r 01-lecture1-49, eval = F}
select(weather, starts_with("d"))
```

## mutate

`mutate` can either transform a column in place or create a new column in a dataset

We'll use the in-built `mpg` dataset for this example, We'll select only the city and highway mileages. To use this selection later, we will need to assign it to a new name

```{r 01-lecture1-50}
mpg1 <- select(mpg, cty, hwy)

```

## mutate

We'll change the city and highway mileage to km/l from mpg. 
This will involve multiplying it by 1.6 and dividing by 3.8

```{r 01-lecture1-51}
head(mutate(mpg1, cty = cty * 1.6 / 3.8, 
            hwy = hwy * 1.6/3.8), 5)
```
>This is in-place replacement

## New Variable Defined

```{r 01-lecture1-52}
mutate(mpg1, cty1 = cty * 1.6/3.8, hwy1 = hwy * 1.6/3.8)
```
>This creates new variables

## filter

`filter` extracts rows based on criteria

```{r 01-lecture1-53}
filter(mpg, cyl == 4)
```

This extracts only 4 cylinder vehicles

Other choices might be `cyl != 4`, `cyl > 4`, `year == 1999`, `manufacturer=="audi"`

## Practice Piping 
```{r, echo=TRUE}
admit_df <- read_csv("~/git_3001/DS-3001/data/LogReg.csv")
str(admit_df)
#Do we notice anything that seems a bit off. 
```

## Coercion num to factor

```{r}
admit_df$rank <- as.factor(admit_df$rank)
#changes rank to a factor 

```

## Five Basic Classes in R

- character 
- numeric (double precision floating point numbers, default)
- integer (subset of numeric)
- complex (j = 10 + 5i)
- logical (True/False)
  
## All have coercion calls (example from: R Nuts and Bolts)

```{r}
x <- 0:6
class(x)#why
as.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
as.character(x)
```

## Functional Example: Pass a function get a vector
We can also convert multiple columns using lapply(), great example of functional orientation of R. 
```{r}
names <- c("admit","rank")
#using names as a index on admit_df, 
admit_df[,names] <- lapply(admit_df[,names], factor)

#Check class of those two variables
(as.character(meta_fun <- lapply(subset(admit_df,
                                        select = names), 
                                        class)))
```

>#using a functional with two functions inside that creates a object coerced to a character list...what fun. 

## Using the code chunk below to "group_by" rank
```{r}


```

## Using the code chunk below to filter by 1 in the admit column
```{r}


```

## Ok now summarise by average GPA 
```{r}


```

## Now Pipe everything together
```{r, echo=TRUE}


```


```{r, include=FALSE}
sum_admit <- group_by(admit_df, rank)%>%
  filter(admit==1)%>%
  summarise(mean(gre), mean(gpa))%>%
  print(sum_admit)

```
