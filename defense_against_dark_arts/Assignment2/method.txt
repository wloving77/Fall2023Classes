Method: 

    I approached the problem by first disassembling the target executable and finding a suitable location full of NOP's. I then launched the executable using ghex
    so that I could find the exact offset to begin inserting. I found this offset to be at 0x447 within the executable. This overwrites the call instruction as
    well as the leave and ret instructions. I then begin my own execution. I start by saving the value at (%esp) as this will be my foundation to calculate other
    addresses from. I then inject code to call puts@plt using my own injected string "Wahoo Virus Activated!". I then replace the original string address within (%esp)
    and call puts@plt again to continue normal execution of the program then calling leave and return to continue normal execution.

    a. 
        <main> is located at the offset 0x49B in the target.exe file.

    b.
        <TerminateApplication> is located at the offset 0x426 in the target.exe file.

    c.
        <InitializeApplication> is located at the offset 0x480 in the target.exe file.
