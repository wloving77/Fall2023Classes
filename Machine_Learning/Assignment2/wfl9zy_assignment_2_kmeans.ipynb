    "\"Tonight, more than 130,000 Californians will go to sleep homeless. Thatâ€™s enough to fill Dodger Stadium, AT&T Park and Petco Park. The biggest culprit is rising housing costs. From 2000 to 2014, median rent in California increased by more than one-third, while real incomes for renters fell by 7 percent. Today, 1.5 million Californians spend more than half their income on housing. This crisis threatens not just low-income families but our entire economy, driving businesses to relocate to states in which their employees can afford to live. - **Business Insider, Sep 2018.**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will attempt to cluster the California Housing by implementing and analyzing the k-means algorithm to the data. K-Means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. K-means stores k-centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if it is closer to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid. For references, you may refer to my lecture on K-means or Chapter 2 of the textbook if you need additional sample codes to help with your assignment. For deliverables, you must write code in Python and submit this Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to earn a total of 100 pts. You will gain points depending on how you perform in the following sections.\n",

Using the cluster means and std. deviations as representative values in the cluster, what can you say about the clusters that were found?
